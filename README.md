# Modeling the impact of resource allocation decisions on genomic prediction using maize multi-environment data
This repository contains all phenotypic and genetic marker data for running genomic prediction models for the  manuscript Schoemaker et al. (2024) published in Crop Science.

The repository contains the files, PhenotypicDataG2F_2020_2021.csv and GeneticDataG2F_2020_2021.txt. These files contain the stage 1 BLUEs and 5,000 genetic markers used for developing genomic prediction models in this study, respectively. 

The file CodeG2F_2020_2021.html provides example R code for predicting hybrids in specific environments as done in this analysis.
