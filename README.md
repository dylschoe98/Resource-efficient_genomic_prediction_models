# Resource-efficient_genomic_prediction_models
This repository contains all phenotypic and genetic marker data for running genomic prediction models as described in the submitted manuscript Schoemaker et al. (2024) currently under review.

The folder 'Data' contains two files, PhenotypicDataG2F_2020_2021.csv and GeneticDataG2F_2020_2021.txt. These files contain the stage 1 BLUEs and 5,000 genetic markers used for developing genomic prediction models in this study. 

The file CodeG2F_2020_2021.html provides example R code for predicting hybrids in specific environments as done in this analysis.
